# Front End - for 3D-Printed RC Car
I spotted a [write-up on Hackaday][01], and [elsewhere][05],
about a nearly 100% 3D printed RC Car, called Tarmo3, designed, printed and tested by Kris Shellman.
Kris' website, [Engineering Nonsense][02],
has links to [posted plans][03] and [videos on Youtube][04]
for his PLA 3D printed RC car he calls Tarmo3.

This file contains Kris's work,
[3D Printed RC Car V3 -- Tarmo3 -- Front Parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3546277)
and my additions to it.
