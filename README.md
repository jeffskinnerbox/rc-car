# Radio Controlled Car
In 2019, I was passively investigating options for creating
an autonomous radio controlled car for sometime.
Such a project has the possibility of mixing many technologies
(e.g. RC car tech along with a wide range of sensors, SLAM, FPV, machine learning, etc.)
and could occupy my attention for a long time.
I started assembling a list of like-projects that address some of what I envisioned
but I didn't know where to begin and I didn't want to constraint myself to an initial build.

I then spotted a [write-up on Hackaday][21]
about a nearly 100% 3D printed RC Car designed by Kris Shellman.
Kris' website, [Engineering Nonsense][22],
has links to [posted plans][23] and [videos on Youtube][24]
for his PLA 3D printed RC car he calls Tarmo3.
This is [Kris' third version][25] of a 3D printed RC Car, now with 4 wheel drive
I was impress with everything I saw,
since it appeared to be superior to all the other 3D printed RC cars out there at the time,
so I decide to make my own.
